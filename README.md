# Cifar10 Image Classification
## Overview
Welcome to the Cifar10 Image Classification project! The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. It is a popular dataset widely used in the field of computer vision and deep learning. The goal of this project is to predict the correct class for every image in the test dataset.

## Dataset
Downloading Dataset: Follow the instructions in the README file to download the Cifar10 dataset, which includes both training and test datasets. The training set contains 50,000 images, while the test set consists of 10,000 images.

## Approach
To accomplish the image classification task, we will use deep learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs have proven to be highly effective for image recognition tasks due to their ability to capture spatial patterns and hierarchical features in images.

## Implementation
1.Data Preprocessing: We will preprocess the data, including resizing and normalizing the images, to make it suitable for the CNN model.

2.Model Architecture: We will design a CNN architecture tailored to handle the Cifar10 dataset's specific characteristics.

3.Model Training: The model will be trained on the training dataset using techniques like stochastic gradient descent (SGD) or Adam optimizer.

4.Model Evaluation: Once the model is trained, we will evaluate its performance on the test dataset to measure accuracy and other relevant metrics.

## Instructions
1.The code for data loading, model creation, training, and evaluation will be provided in Python.

2.Make sure to have the required dependencies installed, including TensorFlow, Keras, and other necessary libraries.

3.Feel free to tweak the model architecture, hyperparameters, and training configurations to optimize performance.
